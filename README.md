<h1>My Professional Portfolio</h1>
<p>Thanks for checking out the repo of my portfolio.<br>
It is my first project from scratch, planned to be used as my profissional work presentation.<br>
Another freecodecamp challenge for practicing HTML and CSS, that I wanted to give more than just my personal touch, and improve with React and animations.<br>
The app was responsive coded.</p>
